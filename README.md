Thanks a bunch Bill Gates

**Do this! Not drugs!**

2. Click the button that says "Sign in to launch VM mode."
3. Holy guacamole! You need a Microsoft Account! Use your credentials and sign in.
4. Load the virtual machine by clicking the button or if you sign it it will redirect you to it automatically.
5. The password is `pass@word1`.
6. Load in and profit!

NOTE: Sound doesn't work and a lot of websites are blocked, but it's just fun to screw around with.
